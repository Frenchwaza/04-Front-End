## Background and objectives

Once your core user journey is defined, it's time to build a prototype.

## Kickstart instructions

To save time, follow rigorously the following steps:

1. Signup on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).
2. Download & install the [desktop app](https://www.figma.com/downloads).
3. Let your team leader create the **draft** (‚ö†Ô∏èkeep it in the drafts or you'll be restricted in the number of editors).
4. Let him/her invite you to join the project as collaborator.

## Start with a basic UI-Kit

Before you split up the work, start building all together a very simple library of components in a `UI-kit` page of the project. **By doing that, you will all be more productive and use the same components afterwards**. Keep it simple and only define the following UI components:

- Headers (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`)
- Simple text (`body`)
- Link (`link`)
- Button (`button`)
- Form input (`input`)
- Avatar (`avatar`)
- Card (`card`)

No visual identity or unnecessary details for the moment. Just grey components, circles for avatars and rectangles for cards. Later on, **when you'll have a first version of your wireframe**, you will take time to enhance your components and make them pretty. But not now!

## Build your wireframe

We want to see a functional wireframe. Don't spend time on useless details like your footer's sub-sections or your navbar's "about us" link.

Instead, spend time on what really matters:

- The wording you choose for your headers, inputs and buttons. It should be meaningful and straightforward.
- The general structure of each screen.

A wireframe is here to showcase your user journey. Some **very important tips**:

- Split the different screens (called `frames` in Figma) among team members.
- All work on the same page `Prototype`, adding every new frame to this same page.
- For each frame, take the time to **set rulers**, to ensure all contents will be aligned in the final prototype when switching from one screen to another.
- Finally, **always use the components of your UI kit** when working on a new frame. This is the reason why we've built a UI kit.

When working on a frame, your window should look like this:

## Connect views & test your prototype

Once you have finished your wireframe, test the UX of your app by connecting the views in the **Prototype mode** like below:

## Add your visual identity & pictures

When you're satisfied with your prototype, work on your visual identity if you still have time remaining. Quickly choose:

- **Fonts** for headers & text: you can download `.ttf` files (desktop font format) from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) or [getthefont](http://www.getthefont.com/) for paid fonts.
- **Colors**: keep it simple, for instance a primary color for main CTA and a secondary color for links. You can find color schemes on [ColorHunt](http://colorhunt.co/)
- **Pictures**: also keep it simple by choosing 3/4 pictures max from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) or [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/). Remember to use **masks** if you want a shape (e.g. a circle or rectangle) to mask your picture to show only specific portions.
- **Icons**: only if you have time, you can download [Nucleo application](https://nucleoapp.com/) to build a small icon sets and enhance your components.

Define your visual identity directly on your UI kit's components.

That's the power of components. Your visual identity will be applied to all your prototype turning your wireframe into a beautiful mockup:

Congratz! Now it's time to demo your prototype to your classmates and teachers üéâ.
