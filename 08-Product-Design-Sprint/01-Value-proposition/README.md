## Your app in 2 words

At this stage, you have already worked on your **product pitch** and you have defined:

- Your **target** customers
- The **pain** (or issue) you want to solve for them.
- The **solution** (or app) you've come with to solve this issue.

It's now time to simplify your solution and say what it does in **2 words only**: it's an app to `do + this`. Like for these services you all know:

Your turn! Take your time, discuss with your team and **tell us what your app does in 2 words**.

## Your unique value proposition

Uber is an app to **order a cab** and Airbnb to **book a flat**. But what makes these services different from their competitors? This is what we call the **unique value proposition** of a product. Uber enables to book a cab **in one click** and Airbnb offers to rent **a local's place**. This is their unique value proposition. **What's yours?**

Let's take a bunch of projects from Le Wagon's alumni and see their unique value proposition:

1. **Treatout**:
  - `in 2 words`: an app to **book a restaurant**
  - `unique value proposition`: respecting your food allergies
2. **Kudoz**:

  - `unique value proposition`: no active search, just a Linkedin connect matching most adapted job offers for you.
3. **Skello**:

6. **Happy Papi**
